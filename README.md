Write a program that compares 2 3-digit numbers in reverse. In such a way that the value of ones is more than tens and the value of tens is more than hundreds.
# (input)

The first number is entered in the first line and the second number is entered in the next line. Input numbers are positive and three-digit.
# (output)

The number that is smaller in reverse should be placed on the left side, and then a smaller sign and then another number should be placed, unless the two numbers are equal in reverse, in which case we put an equal sign between them (all components must be spaced). separate.)
